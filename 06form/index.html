            <p>Hello, I am a <strong>Native America:Navajo</strong> artist. I am from Farmington, New Mexico. Currently located in Utah Valley studying Graphic Design. I have tried an assortment of art styles and mediums throughout middle school to highschool. I recently decided my favorite is digital media. I love digital media because of how easily I get lost in it. I am a chill laid back introvert that loves to read or watch kdramas with my two dogs. </p>
            <p><a href="mediums.html#medium">Watercolor</a> is one of my favorite subjects, but the most difficult and challenging style for me. Watercolor is <em>euphoric and peaceul</em> style I love.</p>
            <h2>Why I Chose to Pursue Art</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I had amazing art teachers throughout middle school and high school that inspired me to pursue art as a degree.</li>
                    <li>For as long as I could remember, I loved drawing andd as a kid I would always draw on napkins or anything I could get my hands on.</li>
                    <li>I took a digital media class in highschool that helped me realize there are a lot of careers in art that are expanding and growing.</li>
                </ul>
